/*
Given an integer array, sort the array elements using Bubble Sort.
*/

public class BubbleSort {

    /*
    Approach : We'll run two for loops one will(i) track the number of passed made to the element and the other for loop (j)
    will actually swap the numbers in ascending order. We'll also make sure that we don't iterate over the whole array
    every time as with each pass(i) the last element will be sorted and also we'll put a flag 'swapped' so that for any
    pass(i) if there's no swapping happened that we can assume that the array elements are now sorted and we can break
    from the loop.

    Time Complexity = O(N^2)

You are given a 2D matrix of size nxn, which is sorted strictly. Find the index of the given target element in the matrix.

                {7, 8, 9}}

    Approach : We'll try to eliminate rows and columns according to the validation we apply and at the end we'll be
    left with only two rows and finally we'll try to check the target element in these 2 rows only.

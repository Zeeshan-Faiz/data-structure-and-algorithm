     * Write a program to print the inverse of a given array. Inverse of an array is when the array indexes is placed
     * according to it's index value or in simple statement whatever is the index becomes the value in the next array.

     * Example ar = {2,3,1,0,4}
     * O/P = {3,2,0,1,4}

     *                          0 1 2 3 4
     * if the given array is = {2,3,1,0,4}
     * so the new array will contain the values whatever the index has of the first array, 
     * suppose ar[0] = 2 then second array br[2] = 0
     * similarly ar[1] = 3 then br[3] = 0 and so on.

     * You'll be given a set of books whose pages will be specified in the form of array elements. You have to allocate
     * the books to a given number of students on the basis of below conditions:
     * i)A book will be allocated to exactly one student.
     * ii)Each student has to be allocated atleast one book.
     * iii)Allotment should be in contagious order.
     * iv)All books must be allocated.
     * 
     * You've to return the minimum of total number of pages out of all the combinations when the book is allocated
     * to different students.
     * 
     * Example arr = {12,34,67,90} b = 2(no. of students)
     * 
     * Different combination of allocating the books to two students:
     * 
     *      Student 1                   Student 2
     *      12,34,67 = 113 Pages        90 Pages
     *      12,34 = 46 Pages            67,90 = 157 Pages
     *      12 Pages                    34,67,90 = 191 Pages
     * 
     * Here if we need to find the min(113,157,191) = 113 which denotes that out of 3 maximum value of pages 113
     * is the minimum.

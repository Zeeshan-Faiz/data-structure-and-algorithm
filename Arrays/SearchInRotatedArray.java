     * Given an array integer sorted in ascending order (all distinct elemenets), and then the array is rotated

     * time complexity of O(Log N)
     * 
     * Example original array   = {0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8}
     * Roated array at pivot(3) = {4,5,6,7,8,0,1,2} ; key = 0
     * O/P = 4

     * Approach : If we look closely into the rotated array we'll observe that it has two sorted arrays inside
     * it.
     *                     <---->
     *          [4,5,6,7,8,0,1,2]
     *          <-------->
     * So we'll have two conditions to check for the given key in both the parts of the array using Binary Search.

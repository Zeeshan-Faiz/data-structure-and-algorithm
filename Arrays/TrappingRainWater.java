     * Approach 1 (Brute Force) : There are certain observations we can make out after going through the question
     * 1)We need minimum of 3 blocks to store/trap rain water.
     * ii)Descending/Ascending blocks can't store water.
     * iii)As 1st and last bar can't store water itself, we'll be considering from 2nd starting bar and 2nd last
     * ending bar.
